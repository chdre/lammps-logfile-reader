# lammps-logfile-reader
A simple program to read log files generated by LAMMPS. Supports breaking conditions under the condition that they are named "Fix halt", as in LAMMPS documentation.

Creates an object containing the information in the logfile, stored in as dictionaries. To access data use .get as standard with Python dictionaries.

# Requirements

# Usage

from lammps_logfile_reader import readLog

path = 'some/path/log.lammps'
variable = 'Temp'

log_reader = readLog(path)
temperature = log_reader.get(variable)
```

To get full list of keys (thermo_style)
```
termo_style = log_reader.keys()
```


# To-do
